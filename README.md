# About Me Page 
## Objective

For this assignment, I create a page to introduce myself to my classmates. The page include my name, an inspirational quote, a professional photo of myself (sorta), a table with my birthday, favorite color, favorite food, and whether or not I think pineapple belongs on pizza. I also include a list of my hobbies, a description of how I will contribute positively to the group, and a funny story about myself. Finally, I include a TL;DR summary of my funny story. In addition to the required content, I added some CSS styling to personalize my page.

Finally, I included links to the previous and next classmate page, allowing the whole class to easily click through and get to know each other.
